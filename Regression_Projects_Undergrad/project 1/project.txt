Read and summarize the paper by Box and Cox (attached). Also generate a data set violating at least one of the assumptions of the normal linear regression model and analyze the data set. I need to see residual plots, tests of hypothesis, outlier analysis and estimation details in your writeup. You can use word or latex for your writeup. The last date for submission is 1st March 2013 in hardcopy.
